**Project Name:** Turtle Crossing

**Description:** A game of Turtle Crossing where the objective is to get the 
turtle from the bottom of the screen to the top without getting hit by a 
block. If you manage to get to the top successfully, you'll be reset to the
beginning, and the blocks will be slightly faster! What's the highest level 
you can get to?

**Controls:** 'w' to go forward. Very simple!
